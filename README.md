This is largely a program I wrote to fortify my abilities in C++/Arduino C language because I was bored. This also uses better abstraction methods such 
as storing pin values in a list as opposed to writing a bunch of other #define statements (about 15 if I didn't use the lists). Also uses function definition 
with parameters and for looping.
